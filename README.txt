### Thanks for downloading my mod!
### Features:
Basically, this mod solves the problem of having to manually change villagers in jobs that can't be done during the winter when it starts, then switching them back. Specifically:
When Winter starts, all Forager Shacks and Arborist Buildings will be turned off. All crop fields will have their assigned workers set to 0 and all farmers will turn into laborers.
When Winter ends, all Forager Shacks and Arborist Buildings are turned back on and workers are reassigned to them. All crop fields will have their assigned worker amounts set to what they were before Winter started.
Note: As of now I can't save these counts to save files, so if you load up your game during Winter and the farmers are already laborers from a previous save, then you will have to manually add them back to your fields at the end of winter.
### Installation:
Make sure MelonModÂ v0.6.1 is installed (I haven't tested with other versions, so I don't know if they will work).
Copy the SeasonalJobRotation.dll file into .../FarthestFrontier/Mods.
### Notes:
I'm brand new to making mods, so please let me know what problems you have or any other mods/improvements y'all might want me to make.
Inspired by simpleffmod's mod WinterLaborLand, which seems abandoned.
Thanks to MelonLoader and UnityExplorer for their amazing modding tools.
